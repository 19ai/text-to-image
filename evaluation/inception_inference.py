    See here for reference: http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567

    Args:
    images: Images returned from inputs() or distorted_inputs().
    num_classes: number of classes
    for_training: If set to `True`, build the inference model for training.
      Kernels that operate differently for inference during training
      e.g. dropout, are appropriately configured.
    restore_logits: whether or not the logits layers should be restored.
      Useful for fine-tuning a model with different num_classes.
    scope: optional prefix string identifying the ImageNet tower.

    Returns:
    Logits. 2-D float Tensor.
    Auxiliary Logits. 2-D float Tensor of side-head. Used for training only.
